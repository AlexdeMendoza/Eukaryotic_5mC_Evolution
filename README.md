 This repository includes processed files and is divided into 3 folders:

## DNMT_phylogeny
 This folder contains the DNMT sequences, alignments and trees from EukProt, Giant Virus DB, Mirusvirus, Asgardarchaeota and other sequences.
 
## CytidineAnalogueTreatments
 This folder contains the DEseq2 differential expression results for the TElocal RNA-seq counts on the *N. gruberi* and *A. castellanii* cytidine analogue treatments. 
 
## LGTanalysis
 This folder contains the DIAMOND ten best NCBI non-redundant database hits for a set of eukaryotes (tax.tsv), their gene methylation levels (gene_meth.tsv), and their potential taxonomic origin category.
